Remote Access Simulation for Cybersecurity Research

Overview

This project is a client-server remote access tool developed for educational and cybersecurity research purposes. The goal is to simulate real-world spyware functionalities to understand how attackers operate and explore defensive countermeasures.

Features

Remote Command Execution – Execute commands on the target system via a remote shell.

File Transfer – Upload and download files between client and server.

Screenshot Capture – Take screenshots remotely for system monitoring.

Camera Access – Capture images using the target's webcam (if available and authorized).

Multi-threaded Communication – Handles multiple simultaneous requests efficiently.

Cross-Platform Compatibility – Works on Windows and Linux.

Technologies Used

Python

Sockets for network communication

Subprocess for command execution

Threading for concurrent operations

OS Module for system interactions

Ethical Considerations

This project is developed strictly for ethical and educational purposes to:

Understand how attackers build and deploy remote access tools.

Improve malware analysis and detection skills.

Enhance knowledge of cybersecurity threats and defense strategies.

⚠️ Disclaimer: Unauthorized use of this software on any system you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and against ethical hacking principles. Always use responsibly in a controlled, legal environment.

Future Enhancements

Implement encryption for secure communication.

Add logging and monitoring features for improved detection.

Develop automated countermeasures to mitigate unauthorized remote access attempts.

How to Use

Run the server on the machine you want to control.

Start the client on the machine that will connect remotely.

Use the available commands to execute actions remotely.
